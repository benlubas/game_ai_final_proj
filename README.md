# Rocket League Bot

A Rocket League bot in rust, for CS 4150 - Game AI

## Big Goals

There are two skills that I want to make sure the bot is capable of:
- [ ] Dribbling - keeping the ball controlled on top of your car
- [ ] Flicking - shooting the ball from a dribble
  - [ ] (Stretch goal/would be really cool) Breezy Flick - a special type of flick that
    comes out with unexpected power, and it looks cool as hell

Most of the project planning is gonna stay in the [project note](~/notes/projects/)
